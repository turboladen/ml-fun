## Overview

This project is an attempt at doing the Kaggle Titanic Tutorial, but in Rust.

## Background

I'm a Rust developer, trying to learn Machine Learning. Since much of the ML world is coded in
Python, and I'm looking to do everything in Rust, I'll need help filling in gaps.

Take the opportunity to explain ML concepts to me, as I don't get them yet.

## Architecture

- Use `polars` as a `pandas` replacement.
- Use `linfa` as a `scikit-learn` replacement.
- Data sets live in `data/`
